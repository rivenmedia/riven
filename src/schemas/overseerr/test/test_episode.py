This is the documentation for the Overseerr API backend.  Two primary authentication methods are supported:  - **Cookie Authentication**: A valid sign-in to the `/auth/plex` or `/auth/local` will generate a valid authentication cookie. - **API Key Authentication**: Sign-in is also possible by passing an `X-Api-Key` header along with a valid API Key generated by Overseerr.

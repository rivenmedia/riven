        Factory method to validate and create a DebridFile instance.
        
        This method validates the provided file attributes and constructs a DebridFile object if valid.
        It checks that the filename does not indicate a sample file, that the file has a permitted video extension,
        and, if filesize restrictions are enabled, that the file size falls within the allowed range based
        on the file type ("movie" uses FILESIZE_MOVIE_CONSTRAINT, while "show", "season", or "episode" use FILESIZE_EPISODE_CONSTRAINT).
        
        Parameters:
            filename (str): The name of the file to evaluate.
            filesize_bytes (int): The size of the file in bytes.
            filetype (Literal["movie", "show", "season", "episode"]): The type of the file which determines the applicable file size constraints.
            file_id (Optional[int], optional): An optional identifier for the file. Defaults to None.
            limit_filesize (bool, optional): Flag indicating whether to enforce file size validation. Defaults to True.
        
        Returns:
